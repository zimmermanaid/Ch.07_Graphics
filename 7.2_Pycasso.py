PYCASSO PROJECT
---------------
Your job is to make a cool picture.
You must use multiple colors.
You must have a coherent picture. No abstract art with random shapes.
You must use multiple types of graphic functions (e.g. circles, rectangles, lines, etc.)
Somewhere you must include a WHILE or FOR loop to create a repeating pattern.
Do not just redraw the same thing in the same location 10 times. 
You can contain multiple drawing commands in a loop, so you can draw multiple train cars for example.
Please use comments and blank lines to make it easy to follow your program. 
If you have 5 lines that draw a robot, group them together with blank lines above and below. 
Then add a comment at the top telling the reader what you are drawing.
IN THE WINDOW TITLE PLEASE PUT YOUR NAME.
When you are finished Pull Request your file to your instructor.
